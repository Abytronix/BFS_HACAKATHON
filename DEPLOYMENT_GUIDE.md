2. Enter the path to your BFS CSV file
3. Click "Load Data"
4. The assistant will process your data automatically

### Method 3: Stock Symbol (if BFS is traded)
1. Enter "BFS" in the stock symbol field
2. Set your date range
3. Click "Load Data"

### 4. Multi-Data Source Support
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Real-time data for any stock
- **CSV Files**: Custom datasets (perfect for BFS data)
- **Flexible Formats**: Handles various date and column formats

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### For BFS Data Analysis
Your CSV file should have columns:
- `Date` (or `date`)
- `Close` (or `close`) - Required
- `Open`, `High`, `Low` - Optional but recommended
- `Volume` - Optional

Example format:
```csv
Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2024-01-01,150.0,155.0,149.0,154.0,1000000
2024-01-02,154.0,156.0,153.0,155.5,1200000
```

### System Requirements
- **Google Colab**: No local requirements (cloud-based)
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: No local requirements (cloud-based)
- **Local**: Python 3.8+, 4GB RAM recommended

## üîß Customization Options

### 1. Model Selection (Full Version)
```python
# Use different LLM models
assistant = StockAnalysisAssistant(model_name="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")
assistant = StockAnalysisAssistant(model_name="google/gemma-2b-it")
```

### 2. Technical Indicators
Modify the `calculate_technical_indicators()` method to add:
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- Fibonacci retracements
- Custom indicators

### 3. Chart Customization
Adjust colors, timeframes, and indicators in the `create_interactive_chart()` method.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No data loaded" error**
- Check your file path or stock symbol
- Ensure your CSV has the required columns
- Verify internet connection for Yahoo Finance data

**2. Memory issues with LLM**
- Use the simplified `app.py` version
- Reduce the model size
- Use Google Colab's free GPU

**3. Charts not displaying**
- Ensure Plotly is installed
- Check if data was loaded successfully
- Try refreshing the browser

### Performance Tips
- Use smaller date ranges for faster processing
- The simplified version (`app.py`) loads faster
- Google Colab provides free GPU access

## üìà Advanced Usage

### 1. Batch Analysis
```python
# Analyze multiple stocks
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']
for stock in stocks:
    assistant.load_stock_data(stock)
    analysis = assistant.analyze_stock_data()
    print(f"{stock}: {analysis}")
```

### 2. Custom Questions
```python
# Add your own question handlers
def custom_question_handler(question):
    if "custom_metric" in question.lower():
        return calculate_custom_metric()
    return None
```

### 3. Export Results
```python
# Export analysis to CSV
analysis_data = assistant.analyze_stock_data()
df = pd.DataFrame([analysis_data])
df.to_csv('bfs_analysis.csv')
```
