## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED:**

### **1. Encoding Detection:**
```python
# Before: Failed parsing
df = pd.read_csv('BFS_Share_Price.csv')  # ❌ Error

# After: Smart encoding detection
import chardet
with open('BFS_Share_Price.csv', 'rb') as f:
    encoding = chardet.detect(f.read())['encoding']  # UTF-8-SIG
df = pd.read_csv('BFS_Share_Price.csv', encoding=encoding)  # ✅ Works
```

### **2. Date Parsing Fix:**
```python
# Your date format: 3-Jan-22
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%d-%b-%y')  # ✅ Perfect
```

### **3. Robust Error Handling:**
```python
# Multiple fallback methods
1. Standard CSV loading
2. UTF-8-SIG encoding
